This is the zettelgarten of Spencer Saar Cavanaugh, an experimental knowledge graph blending the zettelkasten method with the spirit of digital gardening. The primary purpose of this zettelgarten is to cultivate knowledge in a public manner, and to provide an auditable intellectual substrate for published discourse (see [Writing](/writing.html)).

## Content

This zettelgarten contains mostly reading notes, but also various long-form notes about epistemology, political science, knowledge management, and other topics.

### Specifications

These documents are generated programmatically via AI, according to frameworks and directives I provide (see [[Scoping Document Framework]]). They serve as preliminary structural outlines for projects, as points of departure for more intentional refinement.

#### Preliminary

- [[Integrating Quartz and Arwiki]]
- [[Service Schema Scoping]]

#### Refined

- [[Cursor Rules Framework]]

---

## Architecture

This site uses a multi-modal architecture, functioning as a professional website, a portfolio, a blog, a digital garden, and a zettelkasten.

  <img src="https://arweave.net/KN9HUQIZ8Mpt0ibeMaIQMa1hWWwSgxFLQPLoyzrwh54" class="gallery-img" alt="Multi-modal site architecture">

### File Naming

#### Reference Note Format

"r-AuthorInitials-TitleInitials-1" or "r-JK-GT-1"

For example, the first note made primarily in reference to John Maynard Keynes' _General Theory_ would be r-JK-GT-1, the second would be r-JK-GT-2, etc. See this [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/1f8hap4/how_i_give_ids_to_my_reference_notes/) for more information.

This method permits the interstitial inclusion of recursive reference notes, along the lines of folgezettel. For example, note r-JK-GT-1a could be made in reference to r-JK-GT-1, perhaps as a correction or an elaboration.

### File Storage

Arweave is the primary storage solution for this zettelkasten. Arweave hashes function as the primary URIs for inline images, videos, and other media.

```md
MALjimE4g6_dO_DOWwbA_LOPOCNQkjI2v2aL3oYuG3w
```

For example, the following markdown code renders the subsequent image in the browser:

```md
![The Baths of Caracalla](https://arweave.net/MALjimE4g6_dO_DOWwbA_LOPOCNQkjI2v2aL3oYuG3w)
```

![The Baths of Caracalla](https://arweave.net/MALjimE4g6_dO_DOWwbA_LOPOCNQkjI2v2aL3oYuG3w)

Arweave hashes are also used as URIs in frontmatter for page metadata. For example, page banners are expressed as:

```yaml
bannerURI: https://arweave.net/1OCpB8IN7kO8LiEOoutCLSSyGbHLHfhoJSQoloN_Y5g
```

### Frontmatter

Below is the full annotated frontmatter for the pages on this site. Not all pages will use all of the fields, and many of the fields are not required. Additionally, some of the fields are specific to this particular Quartz site(such as the 'quartzShowGraph' field). Some field are still in development.

Arweave is the preferred permanent storage solution for this site's static assets, with content accessible via Arweave-based URIs.
