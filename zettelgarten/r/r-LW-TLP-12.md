![[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#4.041]]

The state of affairs cannot be apprehended beyond the depiction itself, which itself is only an approximation of what it depicts. Here, though, I find it odd that he uses the term "mathematical multiplicity" to describe both the depiction and what is depicted, as if mathematics has any bearing outside our modality of depiction.
