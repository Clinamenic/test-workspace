#r/LW/TLP/Q I don't understand what he means by "formal concept", but more broadly I think I understand the sensibility around discerning which questions are working asking, in a spirit of epistemic pragmatism, and in accordance with how he seems to be framing the enterprise of philosophy writ large, i.e. as the work of determining the optimal lines of inquiry.
