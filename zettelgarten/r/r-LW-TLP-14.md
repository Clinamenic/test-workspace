![[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#5.234]]

Here the distinction between "operation" and "function" isn't quite clear to me, nor am I even sure if the distinction here presented is a conventional one, or one particular to the internal logic of the Tractatus. It seems to me like a function is an operation on a base, where a base would essentially be the argument of the function.
