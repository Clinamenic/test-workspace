![[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#6.113]]

In 6.113 he maintains that logical propositions are characterized by their truth being self-evident, in the manner of immanent rationalism, rather than their truth being predicated on some extrinsic condition (empirically or rationally). What I am unclear on, is whether this whole project of the Tractatus, namely of setting out to frame a logical system in full propriety, is ultimately geared around devising a robust practical heuristic for better knowing how to ask potent questions, or how to avoid asking misguided questions; and whether, as part of devising such a heuristic framework, the framework itself needs to acknowledge its own limitations by disavowing itself.
