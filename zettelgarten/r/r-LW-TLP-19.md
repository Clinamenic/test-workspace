[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]

Reflection: Now having finished the initial linearized reading of the Tractatus, and having securing as broad sense of its scope, it strikes me as a good time to reflect upon my present comprehension of the work. 

A large portion of the more granular items in the Tractatus were over my head, but I do feel like the overall message was received, largely according to the ways in which Wittgenstein predicts readers will understand it, i.e. by virtue of heir already having thought through similar things. At present, I understand some of the primary messages, such as that a bulk of the ostensible challenges in philosophy, across history, result from misguided or poorly framed inquiries. 

I also already has a pretty visceral apprehension of the limits of systematization with respect to representing the world, i.e. "the map is not the territory" and "all models are wrong, but some are useful." In this spirit, the Tractatus seems to be prescribing a heuristic epistemology for orienting ones impetus of inquiry, around which propositions may emanate which are conducive to the acquisition of enduring knowledge.
