![[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#2.1515]]

Here I would say, rather, that depictions only, at best, asymptotically approximate the things they depict, and do not "touch" them in any significant way. That said, I get the sense that Wittgenstein may not literally be asserting here that language can absolutely identify reality, but rather that this line of argument is needed to properly convey what the Tractatus, as a self-disavowing discursive edifice, strives to convey, i.e. its almost like the Tractatus needs to posit it in a certain way in order to ultimately convey the intended message.
