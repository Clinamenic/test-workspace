![[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus#3.221]]

Again, in the spirit of map vs territory, he seems to be saying that we can only "point" to objects in reality.

#r/LW/TLP/Q is it accurate, in the parlance of the Tractatus, to say that a proposition can only say how a thing is, provided it accurately obtains the states-of things it depicts?
